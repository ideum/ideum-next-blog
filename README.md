Apparently WordPress is being used as a git submodule, perhaps as a custom variation of <a href="https://github.com/ErikFontanel/Wordpress-Corpse#problems-commitingupdating-after-updating-wordpress">WordPress Corpse</a>.

Sadly, there is no documentation about what variations were used,the logic behind those decisions, nor how to update WordPress (if desired for security reasons) beyond the version used by WordPress Corpse (currently 4.0).
