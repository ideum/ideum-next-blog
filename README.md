Site for Ideum

WordPress is being used as a git submodule. See our 'Ideum Site Maintenance - General' doc for how to update WordPress via the command line.

If you try and update the version from within WordPress Admin or by updating local dev copy by manually switching out files and folders, the next time you push any changes to the site the WordPress version will revert to whatever the git head of the WordPress submodule indicates.
